                    <p className="description">Upward Bangladesh is a youth organization founded on 21st May 2020 to help aspiring young leaders chase their dream. We dream of a country where the young prospects will not be tired of finding jobs and will be confident enough to start something on their own and create more opportunities for others. We wish to help the young entrepreneurs by giving their newly built startups a much-needed promotional boost. We also inspire to use Bangladeshi products over multi-national country products to make a self-dependent Bangladesh one day.</p>
